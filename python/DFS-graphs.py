# Implementing DFS for graphs

# In this exercise, you will implement a depth first search algorithm to traverse a graph.

# Recall the steps:

#     Start at any vertex
#     Add the vertex to the visited vertices list
#     For each current node's adjacent vertex
#         If it has been visited -> ignore it
#         If it hasn't been visited -> recursively perform DFS

# To help you test your code, the following graph has been loaded using a dictionary.

# Graphical representation of a graph.

# graph = {
#   '0' : ['1','2'],
#   '1' : ['0', '2', '3'],
#   '2' : ['0', '1', '4'],
#   '3' : ['1', '4'],
#   '4' : ['2', '3']
# }

def dfs(visited_vertices, graph, current_vertex):
    # Check if current_vertex hasn't been visited yet
    if current_vertex not in visited_vertices:
        print(current_vertex)
        # Add current_vertex to visited_vertices
        visited_vertices.add(current_vertex)
        for adjacent_vertex in graph[current_vertex]:
            # Call recursively with the appropriate values
            dfs(visited_vertices, graph, adjacent_vertex)
            
dfs(set(), graph, '0')
